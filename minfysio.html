                    After analyzing the technology radar and thorough brainstorming on all the possible directions we
                    could move towards, we decided to create an app, since other technologies such as VR and AR are
                    still in the development phase and have yet to meet their peak. For the topic of welfare technology
                    we chose Physiotherapy as it hit close to home for us and we felt we could really innovate on a
                    feasible, desirable and viable solution.

                    <div class="subpage_text">
                        After diving deeper into research and the wants, needs and pain points of people who have
                        undergone Physiotherapy we had the following findings.
                        <br><br>
                        Most of the patients struggle to complete all their exercises, this primarily because they only
                        receive a verbal or at most written explanation of the exercises to complete but more than that
                        once patients start feeling better they stop their training almost immediately and either stop
                        their visits at the physiotherapist, just do the exercises before the meeting and in some cases
                        even lie when asked about the consistency of their training. The Physiotherapists that we spoke
                        to emphasized this problem as well say that patients should keep up their training routines even
                        after they “think” they have recovered as it often leads to recurring problems down the line.
                        <br><br>
                        For this reason we decided to try and solve this problem by creating an app which would educate
                        patients and motivate them to complete their full recovery program.

                <div class="subpage_subheader">REHABILITATION & RECOVERY</div>
                <div class="subpage_text">
                    For our solution we mainly worked with two target groups, the patients and the physiotherapists
                    themselves. We set out to create a platform which would be used by all physiotherapists, with a
                    database full of video exercises, allowing the physiotherapists to essentially drag and drop the
                    relevant exercises for the patient and change and adapt them to how the patient's recovery process
                    is progressing, simplifying the process for the physiotherapists as well as providing the patients
                    with comprehensive easy to follow videos.
                    <br><br>
                    Patients would receive the app on their first visit and to help motivate them to complete their full
                    recovery and not skip out on their rehabilitation we included simple forms of gamification, such as
                    streaks and completion rates. The app would remind patients of their exercises in the form of push
                    notifications and have a slide to complete button once the exercise was over. Their physiotherapist
                    would have an overview of all their patients and their completion rates and both sides would have an
                    easy line of communication through a basic chat feature.

                <div class="subpage_text">
                    After finalizing our solution we turned our focus on implementation. We decided to work with change
                    design and here we realized the best way forward was to push our solution through the government and
                    public physiotherapists first, adding yet another target audience. Once the app was being used by
                    the majority of public physiotherapists the Danish Kommune would receive consolidated data in the
                    form of a dashboard, saving them a lot of time and effort and providing them with usual data in
                    terms of general health and health care of their citizens. Our plan relied on using Kotter’s Theory
                    of change and the ADKAR model to make sure the addition of a new product would be easily adopted in
                    every stage and for each specific stakeholder.</div>

                <div class="subpage_text">
                    Previously my projects had been focused on only creating a digital solution, meanwhile for this
                    project the focus was on implementation. For that reason I felt the learning experience was immense
                    and gave me a much deeper understanding and respect of how to navigate the inner workings of
                    multiple stakeholders, different communication channels and how the impact of one slight change in
                    the already existing model can cause disruption and a negative impact if the planning of its
                    implementation isn’t fully thought through, even if the new solution is better.
