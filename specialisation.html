    <div class="subpage_text">
        As a group we chose the topic of immersive Web animations, we decided in the end to go all out and put our learnings into practice. Why just make a normal presentation? Instead we actually implemented our learnings in the form of a simple website in order to showcase the true potential of immersive animations.  Separately we found several different types of animations we found interesting and began implementing them ourselves.

    For myself in particular I had always found parallax scrolling effects to be incredibly interesting and eye catching, making the user feel he is part of the journey just by simply scrolling through. I created several different layers of a mountain using different shades of the same color to symbolize distance and with each layer I changed the speed it moved with the user's scroll.

            I went on to use animations on scroll, which were triggered once the page reached a specific height and followed it up with css animations to visually depict the story I was telling with my words. </div>
