    <div class="subpage_text">
        The company we worked with was Smokepins, a small Danish company set out to make the process of cold smoking meat more convenient, and accessible for everyone. They were having trouble establishing a strong brand identity and reaching a larger market. Their website was functional but didn’t portray the product and personality of the company clearly.

        How can our team establish a firmer and solid brand identity for Smokepins ApS, making it more recognizable and overall strengthen their visual and digital presence?
        What characterizes Smokepins ApS?
        What characterizes their target group and what could make them choose Smokepins ApS?
        <br><br>
        One of the biggest problems their previous website had was the first 100vh, when questioned users had no idea what the company or product stood for, especially since it is a niche product.
        <br><br>
        To combat this we decided to work with rebranding and creating a new logo. As well as that we would include a video to both make the product clear and to create a strong understanding of what the company's identity was. 
        <br><br>
        Furthermore to increase the inflow of potential customers we worked with improving their SEO by creating relevant articles to help newcomers and existing buyers.

        <div class="subpage_text">
            As mentioned we worked with designing a new logo for Smokepins, but going further we wanted to create an identity that would really represent the brand at core. We did this by changing the color scheme, creating self made icons, unique hover and active effects, as well as product packaging and marketing tools.</div>

        This was definitely one of our most worked on sections on the website. We wanted to create a unique experience for the users, just as special as the product itself.
        <br><br>
        This idea came to us when we created the “How to start” section, since it is a brand new product and has a specific method of use we thought it was necessary to explain to customers how exactly it is used and we designed this on-scroll animation to guide them through each specific step while simultaneously creating a memorable experience.

        I found this project extremely engaging, specifically because we were collaborating with an already existing company and rebranding it almost entirely. It's interesting how the visual identity of a brand has so much impact on the entire feeling of the product and company. The fact that the company re-used our entire style guide and design elements was definitely a bonus!
