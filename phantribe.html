    <div class="subpage_subheader">HOW IT ALL STARTED</div>
    <div class="subpage_text">
        This all started in an office with four people, we had been brought together to innovate on and create a profitable application. The product was deemed to be sold B2B due to my boss’ connections and understanding of the market, furthermore it was the plan to create an app which would be a way of connecting employees through activities working in global companies. For this reason we wanted to make sure our solution would be inclusive in all ways, so that no matter their age, language and location all employees could participate equally. 
<br><br>
The initial product was called PhanTribe Charity where employees were placed in teams and would gain points based on time spent being active, whether that be walking, running, swimming or any sport at all. It was designed to be a friendly competition where depending on the points collected money would be donated to charity, thereby not only promoting community in the company, but outside as a brand as well.
<br><br>
After PhanTribe Charity was created and taken into the sales process, we discovered that most companies didn’t find the use case to be exactly what they wanted and that we had funneled our product into being directly connected to charities.

    <div class="subpage_text">
        
      
       After our findings we decided to re-create the main focus of the app and make it primarily about creating better communities within companies. We narrowed down the activities to just walking and made PhanTribe GO! A week-long walkathon, where their steps were directly translated into team points. Furthermore we included a touch of gamification in the means of challenging other teams and stealing steps and created a celebratory video template for the companies to post once the event was over.
        <br><br>
        This product received great reviews from the participants and we created a spin off product called PhanTribe Sales to create motivation and friendly competitions in sales teams.

       <div class="subpage_text">
        Even though PhanTribe GO! was working extremely well, naturally companies would not have a need for an event like this more than three times per year so for our start up company to become successful there would need to be a lot more companies onboarded and the effort and time that would take was unsustainable.
        <br><br>
        That is why we began developing PhanTribe Office, which would act as an all year round application for employees. PhanTribe Office would include multiple different types of exercises for employees to do and create healthy routines and communities around activities.

    <div class="subpage_text">
        After working on the product for a while, we re-aligned our solution and discussed a better way forward. PhanTribe Office relied too much on the user creating their own routines by adding exercises into his schedule, this is when we began creating Clubs: Walking club, running club, Fitness club and Mindfulness club. Each club would have mini-events every week with specific use cases, with this addition we saw a lot more activity on the platform.

            Since working on PhanTribe I've made more videos than I can imagine, everything from interviews, to exercises, explainer videos, celebration videos and marketing videos. Having to create storyboards, find, mix and edit music to go along with it, write scripts and even record my own voice overs. It was definitely a bonus being known as the “voice” of the company.</div>

        Because of the extremely fast paced work environment, we had no time to spend working on reimagining the design style of our elements, logo and app as a whole and were constantly reusing all our design elements. I was told that once the app was truely, finalized we would work on making it more loveable. Personally I never got over this matter and spent my free time coming up with new designs for our logo and app as a whole, unfortunately we never had time to implement these.

     <div class="subpage_text">
        Working in a startup can be extremely stressful, that's for sure. The fast paced work environment, having to be always flexible, with your work and your time. I had no mentor to guide me during this process so I had full responsibility for my work and had to keep myself very organized in order to finish jobs in very short time frames, sometimes even against my own will sacrificing quality for output.
        <br><br>
        Although it was hard, I'm ever so grateful to have worked on this product in a startup environment as I have a greater sense of ownership and was always kept in the loop when it came to business plans and what our clients and users are saying. A lot of trust was given to me and I was able to learn and grow in so many different ways, improving my skills on a wide variety of design tools whilst dabbling in all corners of the field. Just to be able to see my own work be implemented, flourish and be used in the real world is something I will always cherish.
