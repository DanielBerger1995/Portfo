    <div class="subpage_text">
        The brand I chose to work with was Bose, a high end company known for its range of audio equipment and I decided to focus on the target audience of young adults, as I believed there to be a big potential for innovative solutions to meet the needs of a specific market segment.
<br>
<br>
After analyzing both the company's brand values and the target audience's various wants and pain points It was clear that because of Bose’s high price tags young students in most cases don’t have the opportunity to purchase the products and naturally lowering the price tags just wasn’t an option.

    <div class="subpage_text">
        Sustainability plays a large role in todays society and is often the topic of many conversations. Bose holds up its end speaking about their approach to sustainability on their website. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The idea behind my concept was re-using “Why not have a page where their own customers can resell Bose products?” And not only would this action shout “Sustainability!”, trading potential revenue into longer lifespans for products and less waste, but more importantly it would also allow customers with limited incomes to make a purchase.   </div>

        <div class="subpage_subheader">USING WEB ANIMATIONS TO CREATE A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE</div>
        <div class="subpage_text">
            Because of Bose’s high quality brand identity my solution had to reflect that as well. I took this as an opportunity to dive deeper into my already booming interest of creating enticing animations in my solution, using them to create a memorable experience for users. I was able to implement several different types of animations, such as the intro text, animations on scroll and hover effects, as well as using a sticky navbar on the “shop” page allowing the users an easy navigation through all potential products in a seamless matter.</div>

        This was one of my early solo projects and I was beyond happy to be able to get a better grip on not only using web animations but in learning how to implement them properly. This project was my biggest step into a world that I was already all so interested in and I can say the knowledge I gained helped me grow and improve in my projects to come.
