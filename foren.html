                <div class="subpage_subheader">UNDERSTANDING & DEFINING THE PROJECT</div>
                <div class="subpage_text">
                    After a preliminary meeting with members of Aarhus Kommune’s Sport & Leisure department I was able
                    to learn that the
                    current digital solution provided for booking of sports premises, is not functional in terms of
                    usabilty. Which as a
                    result causes the employees of the Sport & Leisure department to be overwhelmed by manual email
                    booking requests,
                    creating frustration for both users and employees.
                    <br><br>
                    In response to said challenges, a re-conceptualized digital solution is proposed to tackle the
                    specific pain points and
                    provide added value to the community. To ensure controlled use of resources and enable the
                    adaptation of the solution
                    based on the user feedback, the incremental implementation is suggested in three different steps.
                    <br><br>
                    <ul class="bullet">
                        <li>The first release is focused on user adoption, tackling fundamental access and usability
                            issues
                            by
                            enabling intuitive
                            searching and booking of facilities, visibility of amenities, and a streamlined process for
                            premise
                            reservation.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li> The
                            second release focuses on adding value with community engagement features, allowing citizens
                            to
                            access and have an
                            overview of associations that match their level of sports proficiency, thereby fostering
                            connection
                            and regular
                            participation.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> The third and final release is launching a comprehensive mobile application to
                            provide more convenience
                            and secure user retention.</li>

                <div class="subpage_text">
                    As mentioned previously Phase One was a complete over hall of the existing design and usability in
                    order to meet the
                    standards of Aarhus Kommune and it’s brand identity.

                    User research was conducted to define what was most important for potential users of the solution
                    and how best to meet
                    their needs of searching and booking sport halls. The main findings were as follows:
                    <br><br>
                    Usability had to be easy and accessible for all members of the Kommune regardless of age and tech
                    savviness, filtering
                    and finding Sport Halls to meet users specific needs had to be intuitive as possible. Inclusion of a
                    map for easy visual
                    navigation as well as the amenities provided by each facility and an easy and integrated booking and
                    paying system.

                        With the first high fidelity prototype I was able to test how users reacted to the new design,
                        navigation and filtering
                        options, as well as the whole user journey from searching to booking the facility of their
                        choice.

                    Due to the legitimacy and professionalism of a brand identity such as Aarhus Kommune, it was of up

                    consider service design in all touch points of the user journey. The main concepts worked on were:

                    The goal of Phase Two was to build and strengthen communities in Aarhus within sports and
                    activities.
                    <br><br>
                    To do this I added Aarhus Kommune’s existing database of clubs into the solution, including
                    additional relevant filter
                    options and details to make finding specific clubs easier for each user, such as skill levels and

                    Working alongside Aarhus Kommune for this project made it extremely important to consider all the

                    came to user journeys. From Service design to risk management, being able to understand their
                    business model, funding
                    and future goals and with that design a realistic Three Step incremental implementation process to
                    manage and reduce any
                    chance of said risks.
