                    This project revolved around taking a otherwise commonly “boring” topic and reimagining it into an
                    immersive experience in the form of a 3D video game, where participants would actively learn about
                    the topic and use their knowledge to progress further in the game.

                <div class="subpage_text">
                    We began by brainstorming on the topic of our game, remembering the topic had to be inherently
                    boring to learn. Recycling came up during our discussions but was left behind because of the lack of
                    depth the topic offered. It was only later when we revisited the idea and asked ourselves how we
                    would make it entertaining that we came up with our concept.
                    <br><br>
                    How amusing it would be if the recyclable objects would speak to you and their information would
                    give you the learnings to complete the game. Not only that but as you progressed through the levels
                    you would get harder recyclable objects, such as a pizza box or light bulb and have more bins added
                    to the kitchen thereby slowly increasing your knowledge level by level. We tested the idea quickly
                    among our peers and it came back with rave reviews so we started off the journey.
                    <br><br>
                    With our topic, idea and concept of the game chosen, we just needed to plan out our work and think
                    about our solutions from all angles and come up with specific things that we would need to test for
                    our solution to work the best and be most desireable for potential users.

                        We used Blender to create everything you see in the game, the recyclable goods, the kitchen, the
                        view outside the windows and the very walls themself.
                        <br><br>
                        I worked the majority of the recyclable objects and we decided to use as few vertices as
                        possible to make it cartoonish since we were aiming for a more comical tone of voice (and
                        ofcourse making it easier for us beginners). We all made sure to follow the same design
                        guidelines to keep the style consistent among the entire game.

                <div class="subpage_subheader">YES THERE WAS A LOT TO DO</div>
                <div class="subpage_text">
                    To kick off the programming side of things we created a simple outline of our game architecture so
                    we would have an easier time understanding which elements would be connected and those that would
                    work separately to each other.
                    <br><br>
                    We made sure to run tests at multiple stages to make sure we were creating the best game possible,
                    did players prefer to move around or would the game be better stationary? After the initial concept
                    test we set up the basic lines of code and elements, such as the camera and player movement.
                    <br><br>
                    We separated the other tasks among us, such as the arm and hand animations, facial animations for
                    the recyclable objects as well as their arms and legs, rigging their bodies and making multiple
                    joints to give them a ragdoll effect. We then worked on connecting everything in unity and
                    programmed it to work as we envisioned and made sure to help each other at every stage.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally with most of the game in place, we began working on bringing our characters alive, writing
                    scripts and recording our own voices. Testing the audio lines to see if they were understandable. We
                    had four main voice lines for each object: Introduction as you walk up to the object, Information on
                    which bin the object belongs in once you pick him up, telling you that you’re placing it in the
                    right bin and being upset with you when you would hover him over the wrong bin.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally we tested the audio lines and the basic framework of the game again and with the great
                    feedback we finished by creating the game menu as well as creating a short tutorial for the game to
                    explain the objectives and controls.

                    Once the entire game was functional we created a video game trailer using screen recordings from the
                    real game, although the time frame was extremely short we were extremely proud of catching the raw
                    essence of the game within the frames and yes we watched it multiple times over once I had released
                    it on youtube. Within 24 hours the video had over 40 views, which was incredible seeing as we had
                    only shared it with a few of our close friends, meaning it was being shared by them as well!</div>

                    For the first time working with Blender, Unity and programming in C# I couldn’t be more ecstatic
                    about what we accomplished in one month. Even the core concept itself and the enjoyment we had in
                    working together on a project we all found interesting as well as difficult.
                    <br><br>
                    When we presented it to Kanda, the company who had given us the task, their responses were more than
                    positive, telling us that our creativity in the concept behind the game went even beyond the task's
                    objective and that we should continue to work on the game and release it on steam for 1 dollar.
