    This project revolved around taking a otherwise commonly “boring” topic and reimagining it into an immersive experience in the form of a 3D video game, where participants would actively learn about the topic and use their knowledge to progress further in the game.

    <div class="subpage_subheader">HOW DID WE START</div>
    <div class="subpage_text">
        We began by brainstorming on the topic of our game, remembering the topic had to be inherently boring to learn. Recycling came up and was left behind because of the lack of depth the topic offered and with a question, how to make it entertaining? At this point we were thinking about more practical games likes VR driving or guitar lessons, it was only later when we revisited the idea we thought about how amusing it would be with the recyclable objects would speak to you and their information would give you the learnings to complete the game. We tested the idea quickly among our peers and it came back with rave reviews so we started of the journey.

    <div class="subpage_text">
        We began by setting up the most simple lines of code, for example the camera and movement controls and quickly moved on to blender.

        We used blender to create all our 3d objects, from what you see out the window to the kitchen and walls themselves. 
        
        I worked the mejority on the recycleable objects 
        made sure to use few vertices to make it simple and we all followed the same rule to keep the style consistant </div>
